## Ideal workflow
- Upload data to REST API
- Save locally to server and add to job
- On the job, copy from temporary file location to unity project
- If unity is not already open, start new instance
- (For now) unity will pull jobs and send a request after finish it
- After finishing the job, unity will send it back to server
- The server finishes the job
